# Hexlet DevOps final project

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/pochka15/devops-for-programmers-project-77/workflows/hexlet-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pochka15/devops-for-programmers-project-77/actions)

This is a final Hexlet DevOps project

## Release tutorial

### Step 1. Setup Yandex Cloud

1. Create an account in the Yandex Cloud and install Yandex CLI
2. Generate yandex token: `make generate-yandex-token`
    1. Note: generated token is saved in the `terraform/secrets.auto.tfvars`. This file is added to the gitignore. This is the only terraform variable which is set in the `tfvars` file. Other variables are passed via ansible.

### Step 2. Create necessary keys and passwords

1. Generate ssh keys for the Yandex Cloud: `make generate-ssh-keys`
2. Create ansible vault password: `make vault-create-password password=my_password`
    1. Note: password is saved in the `playground/vault-password.txt`. This file is added to the gitignore

### Step 3. Create terraform infrastructure

1. Set variables in the [vars.yml](./ansible/group_vars/all/vars.yml) and in the [vault.yml](./ansible/group_vars/all/vault.yml)
    1. Note: to encrypt vault: `make vault-encrypt group=all`
2. Setup terraform infrastructure: `make terraform-setup`

### Step 4. Setup webservers

1. Set webservers variables in the [vars.yml](./ansible/group_vars/webservers/vars.yml) and in the [vault.yml](./ansible/group_vars/webservers/vault.yml)
    1. Note: to encrypt webservers vault: `make vault-encrypt group=webservers`
    2. Also: to get terraform output: `make -s terraform-show-output name=pg_host` ("name" parameter is optional)
2. `make setup`

### Step 5. Release application

1. `make release`

## Test deployed application

Application will be deployed at `http://your-domain`. I've deployed it to [pochka15.click](https://pochka15.click).
To enable HTTPS see the "Enable HTTPS" section

## Connect to webserver via SSH

`make ssh host=web2`

## Enable HTTPS

When creating terraform infrastructure it's automatically created a certificate for the domain you specified. See the [domain.tf](./terraform/domain.tf) for details. But in order to enable HTTPS you have to wait until certificate status becomes "ISSUED". When it's issued, you have two options. First is to go and change balancer listener manually in the Yandex Cloud console. But this can lead to incorrect terraform state synchronization. Second is to go through the next steps manually ðŸ˜•:

1. Destroy these resources (Note: you can just comment the resource blocks and apply terraform)
   1. `yandex_alb_load_balancer.hexlet-balancer` from the [balancer.tf](./terraform/balancer.tf)
   2. `yandex_dns_recordset.balancer-record` from the [domain.tf](./terraform/domain.tf)
2. Create resources again
   1. `yandex_alb_load_balancer.hexlet-balancer` from the [balancer.tf](./terraform/balancer.tf) but this time uncomment `HTTPS listener block` and comment `HTTP listener block`
   2. `yandex_dns_recordset.balancer-record` from the [domain.tf](./terraform/domain.tf)

What this does is it destroys and creates balancer that listens on port 443 instead of port 80. For now I couldn't find a better way to automate it. Because when I try to change listener without destroying it I get this error: "Either external ipv4 address or internal ipv4 address or external ipv6 address should be specified for the HTTP route".
